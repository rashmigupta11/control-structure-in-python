A simple Python project to check if a number is even or odd and calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50.

##Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Write a Python program that:

1.Takes an integer input from the user.
2.Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3.Displays the result accordingly.

##Expected Output:

```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

```
Enter a number: 8
8 is an even number.
```

##Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

Write a Python program that:

1. Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

##Expected Output

The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
